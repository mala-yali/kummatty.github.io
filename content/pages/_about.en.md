Kummatty is a folklore. A demigod(?). Desi version of Pied piper. He goes to villages after villages. Sings, dances and performs magic tricks. Sometimes, it transforms  a kiddo into a doggo. Cinema is Kummatti.

You can see this anarchist gypsi traits in any wanderer projectionist or in a theatre person who sets up makeshift stage for the evening production.

This is a humble attempt to extend my solace or guilty pleasure in recommending movies and bugging them to watch to my loved ones to initiate a discussion. I know, what you think. Yes, I don't have a girlfriend. Let people without girlfriend also breath 🥶.

Idea is to introduce (mostly non-hollywood cinema, theatres and books on both) and invoke a discussion. Its politics, history and ofcourse aesthetics. 

So, Join the conversation, share among your friends if you find it is worthy.
