Set in the backdrops of a college reunion, the play - This time, makes you feel nostalgic. You may find characters in the play someone you know, or may be reflects you you as well. 

The 80th production by Akvarious productions is a two-hour long laughter-fest. The jokes - sometimes very political and upto the point, were very subtle. The crowd enjoyed the jokes very much and drenched in the laughter fest.

Dialogues, sometimes were very poetic - like a shayari, gave the crowd `Wah! Arrey Wah!` moments.

Actors played their part exceptionally. The cast includes Ganta Ganta fame and Meta award winner Mallika Singh Hanspal, Puranjit Dasgupta or better known as Mantra, Garima Yajnik, Siddharth Kumar, Kshitee Jog. This 6 Vibrant actors made the reunion real with 4 of them performing at least 3 characters each.
