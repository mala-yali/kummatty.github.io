The bilingual movie starring Mammootty is directed by Jabbar Patel.

After 2014, India regained two conflicting personalities. During their lifetime, both of them quarreled a lot with each other. One is Gandhi. The other is Ambedkar. I am reminded of the dialogue in the movie Pa Ranjith that there is a politics in Gandhi ditching his clothes and Ambedkar wearing foreign clothes. Their interventions have made significant contributions in shaping India as it is today.

The movie is available on YouTube.  {{youtube(id="keejOOvSlWY")}}

The film first takes you to Ambedkar's study period at Columbia University. From there, the film takes us to round table meetings and special electorate discussions, ending with a historical juncture to Ambedkar's Bhimayana Buddhism.
